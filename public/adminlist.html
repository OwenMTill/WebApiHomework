    <p>The reason I chose movies as my topic is because they are one of my favorite art forms along with games.
        I go the movie theater whenever most movies come out and I also love going back and watching my favorite old films.
        Movies have always been a way for me to escape or embrace reality depending on what I am watching. They have
        gotten me through some pretty tough times and always make me feel better about my day.
